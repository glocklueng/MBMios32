1) Default AT firmware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ESP-01 module comes with a default firmware which provides an so called
AT command interface.

See also
   http://www.pridopia.co.uk/pi-doc/ESP8266ATCommandsSet.pdf for the command set
   and https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/4/0/3/4A-ESP8266__AT_Instruction_Set__EN_v0.30.pdf
for further informations.


The MIOS32 app allows to send commands from the MIOS32 (MIDI) Terminal with:
!<command>
and it will display received messages.

E.g.
   !AT
should return
   OK


Initialisation Example for WLAN interface initialisation:
   !AT+CWMODE=3
   !AT+CWLAP
   !AT+CWJAP="<wifi-net>","<password>"
   !AT+CIFSR


2) Flash Programming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

But we are not planning to use the AT firmware, but would like to flash our
own firmware with dedicated features instead.

The MBHP_ESP8266 based adaptor provides a special "bootloader" button to
enter flash programming mode.

It can be activated the following way:

- on the MBHP_ESP8266 module, press & hold the "Bootloader" button
- shortly trigger the reset button of this module
- now release the bootloader button

AT commands won't work anymore.

Instead, you can now use the "esp8266" commands provided by the MIOS32 terminal:
[334522.043]   esp8266 baudrate <baudrate>       changes the baudrate used by the MIOS32 core (current: 115200)
[334522.043]   esp8266 reset                     resets the chip
[334522.043]   esp8266 bootloader_query          checks ESP8266 bootloader communication
[334522.043]   esp8266 bootloader_erase_flash    erases the SPI Flash
[334522.043]   esp8266 bootloader_prog_flash     programs a new ESP8266 firmware


Enter following command to check the connection to the ESP8266 bootloader:
   esp8266 bootloader_query

You should get following messages:
[334706.848] Connecting to ESP8266 in BootROM mode
[334706.848] Sync #1
[334706.848] [ESP8266_FW_Read] TIMEOUT (1)

[334707.511] Flash Size: 1024k
[334707.511] Bootloader communication successfull!

It is normal that the first read operations timeout.
This is due to the auto-baudrate detection.

But at the end you should see the "bootloader communication successfull!" message.


In order to program our own firmware, enter following command:
   esp8266 bootloader_prog_flash

This will take several seconds - you should see messages like:

[334826.521] Connecting to ESP8266 in BootROM mode
[334826.521] Sync #1

[334854.769] Programming done...
[334854.769] Booting new firmware...


Again: it's normal that some timeout messages will appear.
At the end you should see a "programming done" message (and no error message).


The firmware will print messages such as:
[334854.773] sl

Which tells you: the upload was successful!


3) Alternative Firmware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently we are using a selfbuilt binary based on the SuperHouse esp-open-rtos
-> https://github.com/SuperHouse/esp-open-rtos

It's the access_point example:
https://github.com/SuperHouse/esp-open-rtos/tree/master/examples/access_point

Which opens an AP with the name "esp-open-rtos AP"

Connect to this AP with the WLAN interface of your computer.

Enter the password "esp-open-rtos"


Now you can connect to the AP with following telnet command:
   telnet 172.16.0.1

you should get following messages:
---
Trying 172.16.0.1...
Connected to 172.16.0.1.
Escape character is '^]'.
Uptime 354 seconds
Free heap 32936 bytes
Your address is 172.16.0.2

Connection closed by foreign host.
---


Thats all for now...

Plan: add a OSC<->MIDI bridge to this firmware
